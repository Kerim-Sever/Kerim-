**Git**: Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
 
**Github**: Github is a Git repository hosting service, but it adds many of its own features. While Git is a command line tool, GitHub provides a Web-based graphical interface

**Repository**: Contains all the project files and the documents behind it. It stores every revision made on a file, creating a detailed history for every repository made. It can contain many collaborators and can be either public or private.


**Clone**: This command makes a copy of the repository that is located on your computer. The user can edit the files and use Git to keep track of the changes made without having to be online. It is connected to the remote version so that changes can be synced between the two or the user can push local changes to the remote to keep them synched when they're online.

**Commit**: A commit is a change or revision to a file(s). Every time you commit something, it creates a unique id that allows the user to keep track of the changes that were or are being made and by whom and when. It contains a comment section (commit message) that is a short description about the changes made.

**Push**: When you send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.

**Pull**: command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update the local repository to match that content.

**Branch**: Branching allows multiple people to work on the same project. Branching is a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches

**Merge**: Pull request's commits are squashed into a single commit. Instead of seeing all of a contributor's individual commits from a topic branch, the commits are combined into one commit and merged into the default branch.

**Merge Conflict**: This usually happens when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge. Git can often resolve differences between branches and merge them automatically.

**Fetch**: Retrieves new work done by other people. Fetching from a repository grabs all the new remote-tracking branches and tags without merging those changes into your own branches.

**Remote**: common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes.
